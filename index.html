    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>ArtiFlow Studio ("we", "us", or "our") respects the privacy of our users ("user" or "you"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application ArtiFlow. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>ArtiFlow is designed to respect user privacy. Currently, we do not collect any personal data directly through the application. The application may, however, allow users to generate content within the app, which we reserve the right to store in the future.</p>
    <h2>Generated Content</h2>
    <p>User-Generated Content: Any content generated by users within the ArtiFlow app is stored locally on the user's device. Should the app be uninstalled, this content will be lost unless saved by the user elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Future Storage: We reserve the right to store user-generated content within the application in the future. Users will be notified of any changes to this practice and will have control over their generated content.</p>
    <h2>Use of Secure Connection</h2>
    <p>Our application uses HTTPS to ensure the security of data transmitted over the internet.</p>
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>ArtiFlow utilizes third-party services to enhance the app's functionality. These services include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob for advertising purposes. For details on their privacy practices, refer to <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank">Google AdMob's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li>Midjourney, in conjunction with GoAPI, for image generation and content moderation. Midjourney is used for its advanced image generation capabilities, while GoAPI serves as an intermediary that facilitates communication with Midjourney and provides additional moderation to ensure the user-generated content meets our community standards and to prevent unwanted content. For privacy practices, please refer to <a href="https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Midjourney's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.goapi.ai/privacy-policy" target="_blank">GoAPI's Privacy Policy</a> respective privacy policies .</li>
        <li>Google Firebase services for analytics, crash reporting, logging, and configuration management. Details are provided in <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li>Detect Language API for text language recognition. Details are provided in <a href="https://detectlanguage.com/privacy_policy" target="_blank">Detect Language API Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li>Detect ImgBB for processing user images into public URLs for use with Midjourney. Details are provided in <a href="https://imgbb.com/privacy" target="_blank">ImgBB Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Handling User Images with ImgBB</h2>
 <p>To facilitate the image generation process with Midjourney, ArtiFlow now utilizes ImgBB for temporary image uploads. This change allows us to create a public URL for Midjourney to access the image, as it only accepts public URLs for processing. We remain committed to your privacy and data security throughout this process:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Temporary Storage: User images are temporarily uploaded to ImgBB to generate a public URL for Midjourney's access. The images are hosted for a brief duration to facilitate this process.</li>
    <li>Deletion Policy: The images are automatically deleted from ImgBB after 60 seconds, ensuring they are not stored any longer than necessary for the image generation process.</li>
    <li>Data Security: We employ secure connections and adhere to best practices in data security and privacy to safeguard the images you upload during this process.</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Subscription Features</h2>
    <p>ArtiFlow offers subscription features through Google Play, including a paid daily trial, weekly, and monthly subscriptions. Google is responsible for handling refunds. Please refer to <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en-US_us/about/play-terms/" target="_blank">Google Play's terms of service and privacy policy</a> for more details.</p>
    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access and control the content you generate within the application. Since the application does not collect personal data, the management of generated content is limited to local device storage.</p>
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide additional notification (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification directly within the application).</p>
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or comments about this policy, you may email us at <a href="mailto:artiflow.help@gmail.com">artiflow.help@gmail.com</a>.</p>
